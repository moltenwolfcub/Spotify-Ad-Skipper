# Spotify Skip Ads
### Designed for Ubuntu and requires `wmctrl` and `dbus-send`

A simple bash script to close and reopen spotify (which skips the
advert) before playing the audio again.

I won't do much with this so don't expect me to support any other
versions or keep this up-to-date. If you want to use this yourself
have a read through the code make a fork and try to adapt it to your
operating system
